This plugin's goal is to show product quantity field in the product thumbnail after it has been added to the cart.

== Description ==

This plugin works after adding any product to the cart with woocommerce's ajax 'Add to cart' button. After adding any product to the cart from any shop loop (It can be a section of homepage or shop page), the quantity input field with a 'plus' and 'minus' will appear in the place of that 'Add to cart' button. The field won't be visible until a product has been added to the cart. From the quantity field you can then add the product in bulk just by increasing the quantity with the 'Plus' button. you can also decrease the quantity if you have added some extra by mistake. As simple as that.
